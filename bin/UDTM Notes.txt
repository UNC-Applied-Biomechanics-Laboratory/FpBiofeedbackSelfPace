UDTM NOTES

To do before:
- Fill in IP addresses in communication variables
- Locate ideal 'center' of treadmill
	- variable name is "treadmillCenter", line 85
- Adjust max belt speed if necessary to 1.8 m/s
	- "MaxBeltSpeed", Line 82

Communication Variable Code:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important Definitions:
- A network interface controller (NIC, also known as a network interface card, 
network adapter, LAN adapter or physical network interface, and by similar terms) 
is a computer hardware component that connects a computer to a computer network.
- SDK stands for "software development kit"

initializationStructure.TalkToHostNicCardAddress = '127.0.0.1';
initializationStructure.HostNicCardAddress = '127.0.0.1';
initializationStructure.HostMulticastAddress = '225.1.1.1';
initializationStructure.TalkToClientsNicCardAddress = '0';
initializationStructure.ClientsMulticastAddress = '225.1.1.2';

TalkToHostNicCardAddress - This is the interface we send requests FROM when
 communicating with the SDK2 host. 
HostNicCardAddress - This is the interface we send requests TO when 
communicating with the SDK2 host. 
HostMulticastAddress - This is the address that the SDK2 host multicasts 
data to. This is not a physical device address. 
TalkToClientsNicCardAddress - This is the interface that we listen to SDK2 
client requests on. 
ClientsMulticastAddress - This is the address that we multicast data TO 
when sending data to our SDK2 clients. This is not a physical device 
address. 

***To view NIC properties, open the control panel, access the device manager, then
click on "Network Adapters". Double click to open properties. This may or may not be useful.***

Else, type "cmd" into the command prompt, type "ipconfig" into the command window that opens.
IPv4 address = IP address. Physical address = MAC address (unique to the NIC card)

No hardware changes?
MATLAB just communicates with Cortex, no software installs should be necessary.

Dsable hardware communication for debugging.
Ask Mandy to find code that sets up communications
Matlab compatibility issues?
Adjust origin of code's treadmill? Michael and Katy
	Origin of camera system = bottom right corner
