Documentation for the Matlab SDK for Cortex
Matlab Cortex SDK version 1.0
Created January 2014

The Matlab SDK may be used to communicate with Cortex to obtain data frames
and body definitions in real time.
The SDK consists of the following four functions (mex functions):

1. mCortexInitialize
2. mGetCurrentFrame
3. mgetBodyDefs
4. mCortexExit

Detailed explanations are given below.

It is necessary to always begin with running mCortexInitialize to load the 
libraries and initialize communications. 
This need only be done ONE time. It is not necessary to repeat loading the 
libraries and this will result in unecessary delays in obtaining current 
data frames. 

Data frames may be obtained using mGetCurrentFrame as many times as 
desired.
Body definitions may be obtained using mGetBodyDefs as many times as 
desired.

Following completion, it is extremely important to exit using mCortexExit. 
This will unload the libraries and terminate communication.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. mCortexInitialize
--------------------
returnValue = mCortexInitialize(initializationStructure);

This function takes an initialization structure as an argument and returns 
an output code specifying the success of the initialization.
The input structure must contain five fields and be of the form:

initializationStructure.TalkToHostNicCardAddress = '127.0.0.1';
initializationStructure.HostNicCardAddress = '127.0.0.1';
initializationStructure.HostMulticastAddress = '225.1.1.1';
initializationStructure.TalkToClientsNicCardAddress = '0';
initializationStructure.ClientsMulticastAddress = '225.1.1.2';

TalkToHostNicCardAddress - This is the interface we send requests FROM when
 communicating with the SDK2 host. 
HostNicCardAddress - This is the interface we send requests TO when 
communicating with the SDK2 host. 
HostMulticastAddress - This is the address that the SDK2 host multicasts 
data to. This is not a physical device address. 
TalkToClientsNicCardAddress - This is the interface that we listen to SDK2 
client requests on. 
ClientsMulticastAddress - This is the address that we multicast data TO 
when sending data to our SDK2 clients. This is not a physical device 
address. 

The above values are suggested defaults. 
Arguments Must be in the form 'a.b.c.d'

The following possible return values may occur:
0: Okay
1: General Error
2: Invalid use of the API
3: Network Error

2. mGetCurrentFrame
-------------------
